## Approach #1 Sorting and two pointers  [Accepted]

**Intuition**

if we want to satisfy most children, the choice of size of cookie must be as close as possible to greedy factor.

We sort the size of cookie and greed factor, and we use 2 index to traverse both array to compare with each other.

We use two version loops, first one is `while` loop.

`while` needs index to ensure index not be exceed length of array, and it increments index by 1 

because `for` itself can represent iteration of `s`


**Algorithm**

1. sort `g`, `s`
2. initialize index variable and number of children being satisfied
3. use loop to iterate both array
4. if we satisfy one child, we increment both index by 1
5. if we can't satisfy current child, it means we need bigger size of cookie

**Python**

```python
class Solution(object):
    def findContentChildren(g, s):
        greed = sorted(g)
        size = sorted(s)
        greed_index = 0
        size_index = 0
        count = 0
        while greed_index < len(g) and size_index < len(s):
            if greed[greed_index] <= size[size_index]:
                count += 1
                greed_index += 1
                size_index += 1
            else:  # greed > size
                size_index += 1
        return count
    
    def findContentChildren(g, s):
        g.sort()
        s.sort()
        count = 0
        greed_index = 0
        for cookie in s:
            if greed_index >= len(g):
                break
            if cookie >= g[greed_index]:
                count += 1
                greed_index += 1
        return count
```

**Complexity Analysis**

* Time complexity : $$O(nlogn)$$

`while` loop:
- increment `size_index` by 1 each time, and `size_index` is always less than length of `s`
- time complexity depends on length of `s`, which is $$O(len(s)) = O(n)$$

sorting:
- compare-based sorting is $$O(nlogn)$$

* Space complexity : $$O(n)$$

`greed`, `size` store sorted array, so they are $$O(n)$$

however, we can use in-place sorting to save space, so we can acheive $$O(1)$$
