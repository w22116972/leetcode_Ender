    THIS SOLUTION IS NOT OK
    The string can contain additional characters after those that form the integral number, 
    which are ignored and have no effect on the behavior of this function.
    If the first sequence of non-whitespace characters in str is not a valid integral number, 
    or if no such sequence exists because either str is empty or it contains only whitespace characters, 
    no conversion is performed.
    If no valid conversion could be performed, a zero value is returned. 
    If the correct value is out of the range of representable values, 
    the maximum integer value (2147483647) or the minimum integer value (â€“2147483648) is returned.
